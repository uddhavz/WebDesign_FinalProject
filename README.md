## Project Features and Requirements integrated:

The user interface of the project is designed to be mobile-friendly and responsive, ensuring that it can be accessed seamlessly across all devices. The UI is designed to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience, with easy-to-use navigation and clear, concise information displayed throughout the platform.

The project includes multiple roles, such as Admin and Customer, allowing for efficient management and operation of the platform. This allows for better organization and delegation of responsibilities, ensuring that the system operates smoothly and effectively.

The Login and Registration pages of the project have been implemented with password encryption using bcrypt for enhanced security. This ensures that user data is protected from unauthorized access, and that the platform is compliant with industry-standard security protocols.

Several pages have been created, including About, Order, Cart, and Contact, Menu to provide a comprehensive user experience. Each page is designed to provide specific information and functionality, such as the ability to browse menu items or place an order, ensuring that users can easily find what they need and complete their desired actions.

The project incorporates several major transactions, such as:

Admin can view all accounts and roles, enabling them to manage and monitor user activity effectively.
Food owners can add menu items, providing them with the ability to update and manage the restaurant's menu.
Customers can view menu items, allowing them to browse and select items that meet their needs and preferences.
Customers can add and delete food items from their cart, providing them with greater flexibility and control over their orders.
Customers can place orders and proceed to payment, enabling them to complete transactions quickly and easily.
All roles can update their profile details, allowing users to maintain their account information and preferences.
The system maintains session management to ensure secure user interactions and data handling. This ensures that user data is protected from unauthorized access, and that user interactions are seamless and consistent throughout the platform.

Data consistency is maintained throughout the project, ensuring accuracy and reliability. This is achieved through careful data modeling and management, as well as effective testing and debugging procedures.

The end-to-end transaction is fulfilled for customers, from browsing the menu to successfully placing and receiving their order. This ensures that the platform provides a seamless and intuitive experience for users, enabling them to complete their desired actions quickly and easily.

The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend user interface, with the option to incorporate additional third-party libraries if required. This ensures that the platform is well-designed and visually appealing, with consistent styling and layout throughout.

A payment gateway API is integrated at the customer end to facilitate order placement and confirmation. This enables users to complete transactions quickly and easily, with a high degree of security and reliability.

CRUD operations have been implemented for all roles, enabling efficient management of data.

The project adheres to REST API architecture principles, ensuring scalability and flexibility. This allows for easier integration with other systems and services, as well as more efficient data management and communication between components.

The Git repository includes a README file and .gitignore to facilitate project management and version control. This ensures that the project is well-documented and organized
